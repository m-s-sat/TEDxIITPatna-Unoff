      <div class="intro">The 2nd Edition of TEDxIITPatna, Metamorphosis, put forth the ideology that permanence is an
        illusion, and everything in this universe is susceptible to change. Change is not always bad- it often brings
        opportunities to transform into something better. While change is inevitable, it is upon us to grow and adapt to
        the evolution of our surroundings. We had experts discuss the effects of rapid and drastic changes on
        technology, entertainment, but most importantly, on people and societal values.
